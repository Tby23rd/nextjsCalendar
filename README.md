# Period Tracker Application

## Overview

The Period Tracker application is a simple tool that helps users track their menstrual cycles. By selecting start and end dates, the application calculates the cycle length and determines the next period's start date. This application is built using React and utilizes the `react-date-range` library for date selection.

## Features

- **Date Range Selection**: Users can select a date range to represent the start and end dates of their menstrual cycle.
- **Cycle Length Calculation**: The application calculates the length of the menstrual cycle based on the selected dates.
- **Next Period Prediction**: Based on the average cycle length and menstrual phase length, the application predicts the start date of the next period.
- **Cycle Length Adjustment**: Users can adjust the average cycle length through an input field to customize the predictions.
